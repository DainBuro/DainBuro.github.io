            <p class="justtext">Team Bucciarati is a 6-man team of gangsters belonging to the Passione gang. Like much of Passione, they are all men and Stand Users. Team Bucciarati is unique in that Bucciarati has built his team out of society's dregs, meeting each of his members at the lowest point in their lives and taking an active role in uplifting them. As such, they are a close-knit group united as much by comradery as by their deference to Bucciarati's leadership. Giorno Giovanna is the only exception to this, having instead convinced Bucciarati to let him enter the gang.</p>
